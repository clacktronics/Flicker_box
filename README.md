This code does not work it simply shows the basic structure
of the pattern but flickers unrealistically and predictably.

About:
I wrote this program to learn about git (and github)
so I can develop my programming skills and develop
my understanding on how to release code, code versioning
and licencing.

This program is used to control an LED strip on and off 
in patterns that simulate the faliure of a flourecent lamp.
Similar code I created was used to make a lighbox flicker 
for a piece of work by Ryan Gander.

I reccomend using a MOSFET like IRF540 to drive the strip.

Typically the pattern seems to be a burst of flickers ended
by a held period before it fails.

There are variables that can be changed to simulate different 
feels.

such as 
* Try to start, breif on period then off and restart
* Constant fast random flickering
* on with Intermittent off flickers
* Long periods of off with occasional signs of life
